abstract: "In risk-weighted decision theory, one additionally has a risk-profile which governs one's worst-case-scenario-style reasoning. Lara Buchak has recently promoted this as an account of rationality that goes beyond standard expected utility theory. We argue that what counts as an appropriate measure of accuracy for the risk-aware will differ from those for standard expected utility theory. In particular, the notion of strict propriety should be replaced by risk-weighed strict propriety.


What, then, do such risk-weighed measures of accuracy look like?


We show that they have to be non-additive. And we construct some, with which one can give a dominance argument for probabilism.
