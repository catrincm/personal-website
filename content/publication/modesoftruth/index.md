abstract: "A few scenarios have recently been considered in formal epistemology that cause challenges for various views of rationality, and are closely connected to the liar paradox. For example, suppose you're going to forget your passport just if you believe you won't, and you know this about yourself. What's the rational response to such cases?
Any credence you adopt undermines itself.


One proposal to account for the liar paradox is a Kripkean account based on a supervaluational evaluation scheme.
I take inspiration from this account to apply it to credence. This gives us a proposal for what the rational response to
these cases would be. Iâ€™ll suggest that in such undermining cases, one should
adopt so-called imprecise credences, which model our opinions by a set of precise credence functions. This allows for non-undermining attitudes in cases such as Passport.


 "

# Summary. A shortened abstract for the summary pages.
summary: "Certain scenarios where one's beliefs undermine themselves can be paralleled with the liar paradox. An application of the supervaluational Kripke construction for the liar can be seen as leading to imprecise probabilities as the rational response."
