abstract: "There are challenges facing the idea of conceiving of our beliefs defined over a collection Î© of the possible worlds (instead of as attitudes towards something more like sentences). When we have beliefs about beliefs the picture of what the possibilities are like becomes more complex. And we discuss some possibility and impossibility results for finding a _universal_ space of all possible worlds when beliefs-about-beliefs are in play."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "What does the space of all possible worlds look like? Especially when we have beliefs-about-beliefs."
