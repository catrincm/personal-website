We propose representing a (possibly imprecise) epistemic state using a probability filter.


This focuses on judgements on sets of probabilities. Instead of having precise probability p, we think about properties like whether pr(A)>0.2; and these probabilistic properties may be endorsed or rejected. Judgement may also be suspended, allowing for imprecision.


Coherent such judgements are given when the endorsed judgements are closed under finite intersections and supersets. This allows for non-Archimadean behaviour.


The framework is very expressively powerful. It can unify work in the imprecise probability literature on desirable gambles and credal sets.
