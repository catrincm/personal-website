abstract: "In this paper we propose a mathematical model for imprecise probability representing an agent’s uncertain beliefs. The proposed model is closely
related to the credal set model, which uses a set of probability functions.
The credal set model can be conceived of as encoding judgements such as it
seeming more likely that it’ll rain than snow. It requires that these judgements be closed under consequences according to the probability functions
that satisfy the judgements. We adopt a similar idea but instead only
require her judgements to be closed under finite consequences according
the probability functions satisfying them. The formal model that we will
provide for this is a collection of probability constraints which is closed
under finite intersection and supersets. That is, it forms the mathematical
structure of a filter. We will show how this allows the model to avoid
some criticisms of the credal set model by Walley which led him to instead
arguing for a model of uncertainty as a set of desirable gambles directly.
We will show a close connection between this desirable gambles model and
the proposed model of probability filters."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We show that representing imprecise probabilities by using probability constraints closed under merely finite consequence, the probability filter model, avoids objections by Walley to the credal set model. We show that it encompasses the model of sets of desirable gambles."
