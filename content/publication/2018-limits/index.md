abstract: "
We present a new proposal for what to do at limits in the revision theory. The usual criterion for a limit stage is that it should agree with any definite verdicts that have been brought about before that stage. We suggest that one should not only consider definite verdicts that have been brought about but also more general properties; in fact any closed property can be considered. This more general framework is required if we move to considering revision theories for concepts that are concerned with real numbers, but also has consequences for more traditional revision theories such as the revision theory of truth.
"

# Summary. A shortened abstract for the summary pages.
summary: "
This provides a new proposal for what to do at limit stages of the revision theory of truth: one shouldn't only consider definite verdicts that are brought about, but more general closed properties. This is important if one wishes to consider a revision theory for probability.
