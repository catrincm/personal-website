This studies cases where one's beliefs (thought of as probabilistic degrees-of-belief) undermine themselves. For example, suppose you're going to  forget your passport just if you believe you won't, and you know this about yourself. What's the rational response to such cases?

Such cases bear a close relationship to the liar paradox and we can apply such solution from the liar paradox to beliefs and develop well-motivated proposals for rational responses. In particular, a supervaluational Kripke account motivates adopting imprecise probabilities in such cases.
