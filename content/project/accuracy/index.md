Accuracy, or closeness-to-truth considerations have been used to motivate various epistemic rationality requirements. I have been thinking about how these apply in unusual settings, such as where one evaluates options by risk-weighted expected utility theory, or the world is governed by some non-classical logic, or where one adopts imprecise probability.
