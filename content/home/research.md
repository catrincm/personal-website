I mostly work on philosophical logic and formal epistemology, and often on the connection between these.

There are two main strands to my current research.

* **Undermining Beliefs and Imprecise Probabilities**:
  Cases where one's beliefs (thought of as probabilistic degrees-of-belief) undermine themselves. For example, suppose you're going to  forget your passport just if you believe you won't, and you know this about yourself. What's the rational response to such cases? Such cases bear a close relationship to the liar paradox and we can apply such solution from the liar paradox to beliefs and develop well-motivated proposals for rational responses. In particular, a supervaluational Kripke account motivates adopting imprecise probabilities in such cases

* **Accuracy for the Risk-Aware and Imprecise**:
Accuracy, or closeness-to-truth considerations have been used to motivate various epistemic rationality requirements. I have been thinking about how these apply in unusual settings, such as where one evaluates options by risk-weighted expected utility theory, or where one adopts imprecise probability.
