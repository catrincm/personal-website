# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We present standard results about representations of strictly proper measures of accuracy. We also show the same results hold when measuring accuracy of previsions more generally."

abstract: "This document goes through some standard results about strictly proper measures of accuracy and representation theorems (Schervish and Savage/Bregman).

It also presents the slightly less well studied case of measuring the accuracy of
estimates of random variables.

The spirit of the document is to include proofs, but to make things simple
in order to make the central ideas of the proofs across, often at the cost of
generality. A number of restrictive assumptions are made throughout.

Full analysis of what restrictions can be dropped in the estimates case requires
further work."
