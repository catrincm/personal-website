# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Coherent sets of desirable gamble sets is used as a model for representing an agents opinions and choice preferences under uncertainty. In this paper we provide some results about the axioms required for coherence and the natural extension of a given set of desirable gamble sets. We also show that coherent sets of desirable gamble sets can be represented by a proper filter of coherent sets of desirable gambles.
