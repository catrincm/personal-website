<!-- I am a lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Bristol. -->

I work on formal epistemology and logic, and often on the connection between these.


I have a particular interest in credal versions of the liar paradox. My PhD primarily worked on modifying accounts of the liar to deal with probabilities. I am now considering whether these accounts can help us understand epistemic rationality in these cases.

I have a broader interest in thinking about epistemic rationality when we reject some of the underlying assumptions, for example, when the logic is non-classical, the decision theory is risk-sensitive, or where the model of belief is relaxed, such as allowing for imprecise probabilities.
